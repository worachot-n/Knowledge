- To publish data on the Web, the items in a domain of interest must first be identified.
- These are things whose properties and relationships will be described in the data, and may include Web documents as well as real-world entities and abstract concepts.
- The term ‘resource’ is used to refer to these things of interest, which are identified by HTTP URIs.

## URIs – Not Just for Web Pages

- "A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides a simple and extensible means for identifying resource." -- RFC 3986
- Many different schemes: http://, ftp://, tel:, urn:, mailto:
- Some URIs for “real world” things:
  - <http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/>
  - <http://dbpedia.org/page/World_Wide_Web_Consortium>
  - <http://sws.geonames.org/4671654/>
