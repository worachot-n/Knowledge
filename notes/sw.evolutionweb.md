## What Led to the Web's Success?

- Simple architecture - HTML, URI, HTTP
- Networked - value grows with data, services, users
- Extensible - from Web of documents to ...
- Tolerant - even w/ imperfect mark-up, data, links, software
- Universal - independent of systems and people
- Free / cheap - browsers, information, services
- Simple / powerful / fun for users - text, graphics, links
- Open standards...

## Why are Open Standards Important?

- Broad industry agreement (if done right)
- Interoperability: cross-application, -organization, -data
- Avoids vendor lock-in: for providers and users
- Open access = no black boxes
- Mandated: by customers, government
- Open, royalty-free standards = good business sense

## Behind the seen

## The document Web is for Humans

The Web is based on the **markup language HTML**
HTML describes

- information is **presented**
- information is linked &larr; dump link (not semantic)
- but **not**, what the information means

> **Goal: Provide MORE Meaningful Search and Processing for Human!!**
