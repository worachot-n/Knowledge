- A knowledge base used by Google and its services to enhance its search engine's results with information gathered from a variety of sources.
- The information is presented to users in an infobox next to the search results.
- These infoboxes were added to Google's search engine in May 2012, starting in the United States, with international expansion by the end of the year.
- Google has referred to these infoboxes, which appear to the right (top on mobile) of search results, as "knowledge panels".
