- DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web.
- DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data.
- The DBpedia project extracts various kinds of structured information from Wikipedia editions in 111 languages and combines this information into a huge, cross-domain knowledge base.
- DBpedia uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a flexible data model for representing extracted information and for publishing it on the Web.
- It uses the SPARQL query language to query this data
