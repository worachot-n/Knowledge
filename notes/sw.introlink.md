## Introduction to Linked Data: A Smarter Data Approach to Semantic Web

Linked Data: Smarter Resources & Links

![Linked data](/assets/images/2022-06-19-20-15-29.png)

- [[sw.introlink.webdoc]]: HTML &larr;Hyperlinks&rarr;HTML
  - Hyperlink
  - Designed for human consumption
- [[sw.introlink.webdata]]: Anything &larr;Typed Links&rarr; Anything &rarr; Graph Data Model
  - Typed Link: give meaning of the link

## Linked Data: Smarter Resources & Links

- More machine-processable information:
  - data connected by relationships

## Understanding Data on the Web

## Linked Data is a way of publishing data on the web that

- Encourages reuse
- Reduces redundancy
- Maximizes inter-connectedness
- Enables network effects

LOD (Linked Open Data) Example: DBpedia

## The information retrieval dilemma

- ambiguity of natural language (polysemy)
- different words/expressions for the same concept (synonyms, metaphors)

## Beyond Keyword Search

keyword search &rarr; pattern meaning
we want to use synonym meaning

## Implicit Knowledge

information Information does not have to be specified explicitly, but must be derived via logical deductions from available information.

## Linked Data Principle

- on the web
- machine-readable data
- non-proprietary format
- RPF standards
- Linked RDF

## Linked Data is

a way of publishing data on the Web that:

- encourages reuse
- reduces redundancy
- maximizes its (real and potential) inter-connectedness
- enables network effects to add value to data

## Summary: Linked Data Principles

- Use URIs as names for things
  - anything, not just documents
  - you are not your homepage
  - information resources and non-information resources
- Use HTTP URIs
  - globally unique names, distributed ownership
  - allows people to look up those names
- Provide useful information in RDF
  - when someone looks up a URI
- Include RDF links to other URIs
  - to enable discovery of related information

## Why Publish Linked Data?

- Ease of discovery
- Ease of consumption
  - standards-based data sharing
- Reduced redundancy
- Added value
  - build ecosystems around your data/content

## Summary

- Linked Data Principles
- Important Standards and Technologies
  - URI
  - HTTP
  - XML
  - RDF
