- HTTP is a data access mechanism.
- Using <http://URIs> to identify things allow people to look these things up.
- Any HTTP URI should be dereferenceable, meaning that HTTP clients can look up the URI using the HTTP protocol and retrieve a description of the resource that is identified by the URI.
- This applies to URIs that are used to identify classic HTML documents, as well as URIs that are used in Linked Data context to identified real-world objects and abstract concepts.
