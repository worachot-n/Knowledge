## Sentence Example

### Cause - Effect

> Pollution causes global warming.
> Pollution leads to global warming.
> Pollution results in global warming.
> Pollution is the main cause of global warming.
> Factories pollute the atmosphere. As a result, global warming is occurring.

### Effect - Cause

Global warming is caused by pollution.
Global warming is the result of pollution.
Global warming is due to pollution.
Global warming occurs as a result of pollution.

*Notice the different uses of 'result' (results in, is the result of, as a result). Students make a
lot of mistakes with these phrases.*

Humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet.

Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste.

Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future.

As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater qualities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.

Governments cloud certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power.

They could also impose 'green taxes' on drivers and airline companies.

In this war, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights aboard, therefore reducing emissions.

Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment.

They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible.

Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as 'banks' for recycling glass, plastic and paper in their car parks.

By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.

In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.

### immigration' topic

From an economic perspective, immigration can be extremely positive. Many immigrants have skills that are needed in the country they move to. For example, countries sometimes lack key workers like doctors and nurses, and immigration is therefore encouraged. Immigrants who find work contribute to the economy of their new country with the skills they bring and the taxes they pay. At the same time, many immigrants send money to help family members in their home country, therefore helping to boost that economy too.

### crime topic

#### Causes of crime and re-offending

- The main causes of crime are poverty, unemployment and lack of education.

- They might be required to talk to school groups or clean public areas.

### city problems

- The cost of living is higher than in rural areas.

### health topic

Lifestyle is a major cause of poor health in developed countries. Most people now travel by car rather than walking, and machines now perform many traditional manual jobs. As a result, people tend to work in offices where little physical activity is required. At home, people are also less active; most adults relax by watching television, while children play video games rather than doing outdoor sports. Technology has therefore made our lives more comfortable but perhaps less healthy.

### road safety topic

#### Causes

- Driving while tired or drunk is extremely dangerous.
- Mobile phones can be a dangerous distraction for drivers.
- They draw the driver’s attention away from the road.

#### Solutions

- The use of phones while driving has been banned in many countries.
- Punishments are becoming stricter.
- Television campaigns are used to remind people to drive safely.
- Speed cameras have become more common.

### job satisfaction topic

It is difficult to imagine a world in which everyone is truly satisfied with their job. Most people work in order to earn a salary, and they would probably not choose to spend eight or more hours each day doing their jobs if they did not need the money. The need to earn money to pay mortgages, bills and everyday living costs is of much greater concern than job satisfaction. In fact, I would argue that the majority of people dislike their jobs and are unhappy about their salaries, working hours, workloads, or their bosses.

### problem and solution

Behavior in schools is getting worse. Explain the causes and effects of this problem, and suggest some possible solutions.

Causes of bad behavior in schools

4. parents / lenient / spoil

Possible solutions

1. schools / clear rules
2. teachers / punish disruptive students
3. parents / support / school rules

### global warming topic

Here is a paragraph explaining the problem (causes) of global warming:

Perhaps the most serious problem facing the environment is global warming. Gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun within the earth’s atmosphere, and this causes global temperatures to rise. This process is known as the greenhouse effect, and human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases which cause it. For example, factories and vehicles produce emissions and exhaust fumes. As many developing countries are becoming industrialized, emissions from factories are expected to increase. Furthermore, the number of cars on our streets is growing all the time, and cheap air travel is making flying accessible to more and more people. Consequently, the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere shows no signs of decreasing.
